# Docker Event Monitoring

This directory contains tools and scripts for monitoring Docker events.

## Files

- `docker_event_monitor.py`: A skeleton Python script for monitoring and processing Docker events

## Docker Events Overview

Docker events provide a real-time stream of server and container activity, including:

- Container lifecycle events (create, start, stop, die, destroy)
- Image events (pull, delete, tag)
- Volume events (create, mount, destroy)
- Network events (create, connect, disconnect, destroy)

## Building the Event Monitor

The `docker_event_monitor.py` script provides a skeleton for building a Docker event monitoring tool. To complete the implementation, you'll need to:

1. Implement the `log_event` function to record events to a file
2. Implement the `update_stats` function to track event statistics
3. Implement the `send_alert` function to notify about critical events
4. Implement the `handle_event` function to process events and take actions
5. Implement the code to run the `docker events` command and process each event
6. Implement the `generate_report` function to create event statistics reports

## Running the Monitor

Once implemented, you can run the monitor with:

```bash
python docker_event_monitor.py
```

To generate a report of collected statistics:

```bash
python docker_event_monitor.py --report
```

## Testing the Monitor

To test your event monitor, you can generate Docker events in another terminal:

```bash
# Create a container
docker run --name test-container -d nginx

# Stop the container
docker stop test-container

# Remove the container
docker rm test-container

# Pull an image
docker pull alpine

# Create a volume
docker volume create test-volume

# Remove the volume
docker volume rm test-volume
```

## Event Categories to Monitor

Consider implementing handling for these important event categories:

### Container Events
- `die` with non-zero exit code (container failure)
- `oom` (out of memory kills)
- `health_status` (health check status changes)

### Image Events
- `pull` (new images pulled)
- `delete` (images removed)

### Volume Events
- `destroy` (volumes deleted)

### Network Events
- `create` and `destroy` (network changes)

## Alert Implementation

For the `send_alert` function, consider implementing one of the following:
- Console output (simplest option)
- Log file entry
- Email notification (requires SMTP configuration)
- Webhook to a notification service (e.g., Slack)
