# Docker Hub Organizations and Teams

This directory contains examples and instructions for working with Docker Hub organizations, teams, and collaborative features.

## What are Docker Hub Organizations?

Docker Hub Organizations provide a way for teams to collaborate on Docker images with centralized management:

- **Centralized access control**: Manage permissions in one place
- **Shared billing**: Single billing entity for all organization members
- **Team-based access**: Create teams with different access levels
- **Audit logs**: Track activities across the organization
- **Shared repositories**: Collaborate on image development

## Organization Types

Docker Hub offers different organization plans:

- **Free**: Limited features, good for small teams
- **Pro**: More features for professional teams
- **Team**: Full collaboration features for medium teams
- **Business**: Enterprise-grade features for large organizations

## Creating an Organization

1. Log in to Docker Hub
2. Click on "Organizations" in the top menu
3. Click "Create Organization"
4. Enter:
   - Organization name (visible in image names)
   - Organization email
   - Select a plan
5. Click "Create"

## Organization Structure

A typical Docker Hub organization has:

- **Owners**: Full administrative access
- **Teams**: Groups of members with specific permissions
- **Members**: Individual users within teams
- **Repositories**: Docker image repositories

## Managing Teams

### Creating Teams

1. Navigate to your organization
2. Click on "Teams" in the left menu
3. Click "Create Team"
4. Enter team name (e.g., "developers", "operations")
5. Add team description (optional)
6. Click "Create"

### Adding Members to Teams

1. Navigate to the team
2. Click "Add Member"
3. Enter the Docker ID of the user
4. Click "Add"

### Setting Team Permissions

1. Navigate to your repository
2. Click on "Permissions" in the left menu
3. Click "Add team permission"
4. Select the team
5. Choose permission level:
   - **Read**: Pull images only
   - **Write**: Pull and push images
   - **Admin**: Pull, push, and manage repository settings
6. Click "Add"

## Permission Strategies

### Typical Team Structure

- **Admin Team**: Organization owners and administrators
  - Full access to all repositories
  - Can manage teams, members, billing
  
- **Developer Team**: Software developers
  - Read/Write access to development repositories
  - Read access to production repositories
  
- **Operations Team**: DevOps/SRE
  - Read/Write access to production repositories
  - Read access to all repositories
  
- **CI/CD Team**: Build systems
  - Write access to specific repositories
  - Often a service account rather than real users

## Repository Access Control

Good practices for repository access control:

1. **Least privilege principle**: Grant only the permissions needed
2. **Use descriptive team names**: Make the purpose clear
3. **Regular access reviews**: Periodically check permissions
4. **Dedicated service accounts**: Use separate accounts for automation
5. **Repository naming conventions**: Clear structure based on access patterns

## Example Organization Setup

This directory includes examples for setting up:

- `org-structure.sh`: Script demonstrating how to use the Docker Hub API to set up organization structure
- `team-templates/`: Example team configuration files
- `permission-matrix.md`: Example permission matrix for different team types

## Alternative: Using GitHub Organizations

If your company already uses GitHub organizations, you can link Docker Hub repositories to GitHub:

1. Connect Docker Hub to GitHub in your organization settings
2. Set up automated builds from GitHub repositories
3. Use the same permission structure in both platforms for consistency

## TODO

Complete the following tasks:
1. Understand the concept of Docker Hub organizations
2. Explore the organization features (teams, permissions, etc.)
3. Document the benefits of using organizations for team collaboration
4. Create a simulated organization structure using the provided examples
5. Implement proper access controls and permissions
6. Create a file called `org_notes.md` with your observations and experiences
