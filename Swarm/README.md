# Docker Swarm Labs

This directory contains labs focused on Docker Swarm for container orchestration.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Docker Swarm architecture and components
- Initialize and manage a Swarm cluster
- Deploy and scale services across multiple nodes
- Implement service discovery and load balancing
- Create and manage overlay networks
- Work with Swarm secrets and configs
- Implement rolling updates and rollbacks

## Available Labs

- **LAB01**: Getting started with Docker Swarm - initialization, services, and scaling

## Prerequisites

Before starting these labs, you should have:

- Docker Engine installed on multiple nodes (or using Docker in Swarm mode locally)
- Completed the Docker Basics and Compose labs
- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- Multiple hosts/VMs for creating a true cluster (optional but recommended)

## Why Use Docker Swarm?

Docker Swarm provides:
- Native clustering for Docker
- Simple deployment and management of services
- Declarative service definitions
- Built-in load balancing and service discovery
- Secure communications between nodes

## Progression

These labs introduce clustering and orchestration concepts and build on knowledge from the previous labs.
