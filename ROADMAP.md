## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Path

The recommended progression through these labs is:

1. **Basics Track**: Establish a solid foundation in Docker fundamentals
2. **Compose Track**: Learn to manage multi-container applications
3. **Swarm Track**: Explore container orchestration at scale
4. **Networking Track**: Master container networking concepts
5. **Registry Track**: Deploy and manage private container registries

Each lab builds on concepts from previous sections, creating a comprehensive learning experience.

## ðŸš€ Prerequisites

Before starting these labs, you should have:

- Docker Engine installed (latest stable version)
- Docker Compose installed
- Basic command-line knowledge
- Text editor of your choice

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Begin?

Select a track based on your experience level and start with the first lab in that track:

```bash
# For beginners
cd Basics/LAB01-GettingStarted

# For those familiar with Docker basics
cd Compose/LAB01-ServiceCommunication

# For advanced users
cd Swarm/LAB01-ClusterDeployment
```

Happy containerizing!

> Each track builds on fundamental concepts and gradually introduces more complex scenarios and best practices.
