## Prerequisites

Before starting these labs, you should have:

- Docker Engine installed
- Docker Compose v2 installed (using `docker compose` without the hyphen)
- Completed the Docker Basics labs
- Understanding of YAML syntax

## Benefits of Docker Compose

Docker Compose simplifies:
- Development environments
- Automated testing environments
- Single host deployments
- Application configuration management
- Container orchestration
- Service dependency management

## Lab Structure

Each lab directory contains:
- A comprehensive README.md with step-by-step instructions
- All necessary configuration files
- Source code examples where applicable
- Troubleshooting tips and best practices

## Progression

These labs build on the basic Docker concepts and introduce orchestration through Compose. Each lab focuses on a specific aspect of Docker Compose, allowing you to gradually build expertise in container orchestration. The labs are designed to be completed in sequence, but you can also jump to specific labs based on your interests or needs.
